# Testing Cohere Integration in ResourceController

## New Endpoints Added to ResourceController

### 1. Generate Summary for Resource
```
POST /api/resources/{resourceId}/summarize
```

**Description**: Generates an AI-powered summary of the resource by:
1. Reading the actual file content from the uploaded file
2. Extracting text using Apache Tika
3. Sending the content to Cohere API for analysis
4. Returning an educational summary

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Resource summary generated successfully",
  "data": {
    "resourceId": 1,
    "resourceTitle": "Python Programming Notes",
    "summary": "This Python programming document covers...",
    "summaryLength": 450,
    "cohereConfigured": true
  }
}
```

### 2. Get Summary Status
```
GET /api/resources/{resourceId}/summary-status
```

**Description**: Checks if a resource can have a summary generated and shows configuration status.

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Summary status retrieved successfully",
  "data": {
    "resourceId": 1,
    "resourceTitle": "Python Programming Notes",
    "fileName": "python_notes.pdf",
    "fileType": "application/pdf",
    "cohereConfigured": true,
    "canGenerateSummary": true
  }
}
```

## How It Works

### Backend Flow:
1. **ResourceController** receives request for summary
2. **SummaryService** extracts content from uploaded file
3. **FileContentExtractionService** reads the actual file content
4. **Cohere API** analyzes the content and generates educational summary
5. **Response** sent back to frontend

### Frontend Flow:
1. **ResourceViewer** calls `/api/resources/{id}/summarize`
2. **Backend** processes the request and returns summary
3. **UI** displays the AI-generated summary

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test with Existing Resource
```bash
# Replace {resourceId} with actual ID from your database
POST http://localhost:8080/api/resources/1/summarize
```

### 2. Check Summary Status
```bash
GET http://localhost:8080/api/resources/1/summary-status
```

### 3. Test in Browser
1. Navigate to any resource in your application
2. The summary should be generated automatically
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Check backend logs for Cohere API calls

## Expected Behavior

### With Cohere API Key Configured:
- ✅ Extracts actual content from uploaded files
- ✅ Generates intelligent AI summaries
- ✅ Shows educational insights and key concepts
- ✅ Handles different file types (PDF, Word, etc.)

### Without Cohere API Key:
- ✅ Still extracts file content
- ✅ Shows basic summary with extracted content
- ✅ Displays message about configuring API key

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Resource not found"**
   - Check if the resource ID exists in database
   - Verify the resource is properly uploaded

2. **"File not found"**
   - Check if the uploaded file exists in the uploads directory
   - Verify file path construction

3. **"Cohere API key not configured"**
   - Ensure API key is set in application.properties
   - Restart the backend after adding the key

4. **"File type not supported"**
   - Check if the file type is supported by Apache Tika
   - Supported types: PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, RTF, TXT

### Debug Logs:
The backend will log detailed information:
```
=== GENERATING SUMMARY FOR RESOURCE ID: 1 ===
Found resource: Python Programming Notes
File name: python_notes.pdf
File type: application/pdf
Attempting to extract content from file: uploads/resources/python_notes.pdf
Successfully extracted 2847 characters from file
Summary generated successfully, length: 450
```

## Configuration

### Required in application.properties:
```properties
cohere.api.key=your_cohere_api_key_here
cohere.api.base-url=https://api.cohere.ai/v1
```

### Dependencies Added:
- Apache Tika (for file content extraction)
- PDFBox (for PDF parsing)
- Apache POI (for Office documents)

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Centralized Logic**: All Cohere API calls handled in backend
2. **Security**: API key never exposed to frontend
3. **File Access**: Backend has direct access to uploaded files
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling in one place
5. **Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging
6. **Scalability**: Easy to add caching, rate limiting, etc.
